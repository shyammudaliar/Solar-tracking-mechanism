The uploaded .ino file contains the code required to operate a sun tracking mechanism.
This code was developed by me and my teammates at my last summer internship(2019) with the purpose of providing instructions to a microcontroller.
A short summary of the overall Sun Tracking Mechanism project would be the following:
In addition to existing solar panels/ATC tubes, our company designed a module consisting of two mirrors which would be mounted on either side of the panel.
These mirrors with the help of the microcontroller would track the sun's movement and accordingly align themselves to converge solar rays onto the solar panel.
This project resulted in increasing the solar panels efficiency by a whopping 60%.
